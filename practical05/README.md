This practical contains C scripts for the user input exercise, the fibonacci series exercise, and the arctan exercise (contained within programs named user_input.c, fibonacci.c and arctanc.c respectively).

Note that user_input.c will ask the user to enter an integer and a double.

All programs should be compiled in the normal manner (gcc filename -o filename.exe)
