These are the solutions to practical 7 (written in C). The solutions for the first exercise where we approximate the exponential function are contained within *poly.c*. The solution to the dynamic memory allocation task are located in *mem_alloc.c*.

Both files should be compiled using gcc and then running the generated executable:

e.g: *gcc poly.c -o poly.exe* in the command line 

and then:

*./poly.exe* in the command line
